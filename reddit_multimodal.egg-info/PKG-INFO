# Reddit Crawler

This is a wrapper to the `PRAW` package to scrape content from image in the form of `csv`, `json`, `tsv`, `sql` files.

This repository will help you scrape various subreddits, and will return to you multi-media attributes.

You can pip install this to integrate with some other application, or use it as an commandline application.

```commandLine
pip install reddit-crawler
```

## How to use the repository?

Before running the code, you should have registered with the Reddit API and create a sample project to run the code and obtain the `client_id`, `client_secret` and make a `user_agent`. Then pass them in the arguements.

Although, the easier way is to use the `pip install reddit-crawler`.
